For running the My Key Value Store System.

#create the directory for member log files

The log files reside at /tmp/ag. Create the folder and the member writes it logs at this path as 
machine.i.log, where i is an unique number assigned to each member

Ensure that boost libraries are installed in the system.

#run make in the root folder

The make creates an output binary P2P

#bring up the members

Representative command follows
nohup ./P2P --src source_ip --machineno i --interval t --sendpct pct &

where 
    - source_ip is the members own IP address
    - i is the unique member number (It is 1 for the master)
    - t is the time interval to send membership list
    - pct is use to simulate percentage loss of packets. (To use this feature, -DTESTING flag needs to be 
      set in the makefile in the CXXFLAGS field)

The client performs the following functions

    - insert keys
    - lookup keys
    - update keys
    - delete keys

Compile the client using the command

g++ client.cpp -o client

Run the client with the server IP and port as arguments

./client --dst <DST IP> --port 45000

This provides a prompt
For insert
>>insert(key,value)
For lookup
>>lookup(key)
For delete
>>delete(key)
For update
>>update(key,new value)

To see keys and values at the servers, run "show" command at the prompt.

To cause a member to leave

Run ps -ef | grep P2P to find the pid of the member

Issue the commmand kill -15 "process_pid" to send a signal to the member to leave the group.
